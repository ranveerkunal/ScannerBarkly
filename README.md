1. As proud father of [Blue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranveerkunal/ScannerDarkly/main/blue.jpeg?token=AAAUJ4XMSBUVYNCJX4P5PGDAOPK5M)
2. As proud owner of [CryptoPunk 2074](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/2074)
3. And a fan of the film [A Scanner Darkly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scanner_Darkly_(film))

Thought if I could use this craze to fund something in the general direction of helping dogs.
This weekend i saw a clip from the movie A Scanner Drakly and decided to create this collection explained below.
All proceedings and royalties (if any :grin:) from this collection will go to a [Marine Humane](https://www.marinhumane.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/).
